Draw_Spiral_Show is basically one of my first programs from high school.

To activate a program, press `Alt+D`.

Most programs will immediately begin moving your mouse rapidly and clicking. Make sure you have Paint open.

Draw_Circle activates by pressing `Space`, moving your mouse to the desired radius, then releasing `Space` and holding down `Mouse1` so it can draw.

Most programs can be stopped immediately via `Esc`.
