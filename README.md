Draw_Spiral_Show is one of my first programs from high school.

To activate a program, press `Alt+D`.

Most programs will immediately begin moving your mouse rapidly and clicking. Make sure you have Paint open.

Draw_Circle activates by pressing `Space`, moving your mouse to the desired radius, then releasing `Space` and holding down `Mouse1` so it can draw.

Draw_Binary also accepts `Alt+F` to draw an alternate design.

Most programs can be stopped immediately via `Esc`.

Be sure to check comments in each source file for alternate graphing formulas.

[Here's some example output!](https://github.com/Chdata/AHK-KillingArt/commit/a8e74cd6322f73caa7a0879bdcdc345e9b730628)

Eventually, all programs will be fixed to have Out-Of-Window catching that prevents them from running on the Desktop or if they leave the window they were activated in.
