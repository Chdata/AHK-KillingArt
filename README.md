Draw_Spiral_Show is one of my first programs from high school.

To activate a program, press `Alt+D`.

Most programs will immediately begin moving your mouse rapidly and clicking. Make sure you have Paint open.

Draw_Circle activates by pressing `Space`, moving your mouse to the desired radius, then releasing `Space` and holding down `Mouse1` so it can draw.

Draw_Binary also accepts `Alt+F` to draw an alternate design.

Draw_Spiral and Draw_Spiral_Show accept `Alt+V` to display the previously drawn Theta and Radius values.

Draw_Polar includes `Alt+H` and `Alt+V`. `Alt+H` will cause the program to draw horizontally from left to right, instead of in the circular polar shape the graph's coordinates would normally cause. `Alt+V` is the same but vertical.

Most programs can be stopped immediately via `Esc`.

Be sure to check comments in each source file for alternate graphing formulas.
